--- How to play (as a human) ---
Run the wordle.py script. It will choose a random word from the list in "cuvinte_wordle.txt". Next you repeatedly take guesses until you can figure out the word. Guesses must consist of 5-letter words with caps. After each guess you will be returned a 5-character string consisting of x,  * and -. x means the letter you guessed is in the right position in the word, * means it is in the word, but not in that position, and - means it is not found in the word at all. Good luck!
